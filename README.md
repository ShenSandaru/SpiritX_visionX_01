# SecureConnect-visionX

SecureConnect-visionX is a web application that [**Add a brief, high-level description of your application's purpose here**]. This project is built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, designed to provide [**Add the key features and benefits here**].

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

*   **`SecureConnect/` (Frontend):** Contains the React frontend application.
*   **`backend/` (Backend):** Contains the Node.js backend server.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running both the frontend and backend components of the SecureConnect-visionX application.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (version 18 or higher recommended) - Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:** (usually bundled with Node.js)
*   **Database:** (MongoDB - you'll need to have a running MongoDB instance or cloud service. And add the connection string in `.env`)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    *   Add the following environment variable, replacing `<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>` with your actual MongoDB connection string:
        ```
        MONGODB_URL=<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>
        PORT=5000
        ```
       *  If you are using other variables, you can add them to the `.env` file.
    * Ensure that the MONGODB_URL is correct.

4.  **Run the Backend:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
        ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    This will start the backend server on port `5000` (by default).

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd SecureConnect
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Install react router dom
    ```bash
        npm install react-router-dom
    ```

4.  **Run the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server for the frontend, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Accessing the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5173/` in your web browser.

### API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following API endpoints:

*   **`POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup`:** User registration.
    *   **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "your_username",
          "password": "your_password"
        }
        ```
*   **`POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login`:** User login.
    *   **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "your_username",
          "password": "your_password"
        }
        ```
    *   **Response:** If successful, the server returns a token:
         ```json
            {
             "token": "your_generated_token"
            }
        ```

### Stopping the Application

*   **Backend:** In the terminal where the backend is running, press `Ctrl + C`.
*   **Frontend:** In the terminal where the frontend is running, press `Ctrl + C`.

### Important Notes

* The backend needs to be running in order for the frontend login and signup pages to work.
* The server by default is running on the port `5000`, you can change it on the backend code.
* Make sure to add the necessary environment variables to your `.env` file in the backend folder
* **Further Development:** The project is currently in the initial stages. Further development will include implementing more features, adding more API endpoints, implementing roles.
* Add more details if you have other endpoints or functionalities.
* You can change the description of the application to match your goal.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Error: "Cannot find module '...'":** Re-run `npm install` in the relevant directory (`backend` or `SecureConnect`).
*   **Error: "Connection refused":** Check if the database is running and the credentials are correct in the `.env` file.
*   **Error: "Port already in use":** Change the port in the backend configuration (in `.env` or `server.js`) or stop the process using that port.
