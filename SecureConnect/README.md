# SecureConnect-visionX Frontend

This directory contains the React frontend application for SecureConnect-visionX.

## Overview

The SecureConnect-visionX frontend is built using React and provides the user interface for [**Briefly describe the user's interaction with the application here. E.g., user authentication, displaying data, etc.**]. It interacts with the backend API to [**Describe the frontend's purpose in relation to the backend. E.g., fetch data, send user credentials, etc.**].

## Prerequisites

Before running the frontend, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (Version 18 or higher recommended) - Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:** (Usually bundled with Node.js)
*   **A running backend server:** The frontend communicates with a backend server. Make sure the backend is set up and running before starting the frontend. (Refer to the `README.md` in the `backend` directory for backend setup instructions.)

## Installation

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    Open your terminal and navigate to the `SecureConnect` directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/SecureConnect-visionX/SecureConnect
    ```
    (Replace `path/to/SecureConnect-visionX` with the actual path to your project)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the required npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install react router dom**
        ```bash
            npm install react-router-dom
        ```

## Running the Frontend

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser. Typically, the frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Key Technologies

*   **React:**  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **[Add other frontend libraries/frameworks used here, e.g., React Router, Axios, etc.]**
* **react-router-dom** : For routing

## File Structure

*   `public/`: Contains static assets like `index.html`.
*   `src/`: Contains the main source code for the React application.
    *   `App.jsx`: The main component of the application.
    * `components/`: reusable components
    *   `main.jsx`: entry point of the code
    *   `Login.jsx`: login component
    * `SignUp.jsx` signup component
    * `styles/`: CSS files

## Backend Interaction

The frontend interacts with the backend server at `http://localhost:5000/` (by default). If you've configured the backend to run on a different port, update the URLs in the frontend code accordingly (e.g., in `Login.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`, or a separate API service file).

## Stopping the Frontend

To stop the frontend development server, go to the terminal where it's running and press `Ctrl + C`.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Error: "Cannot find module '...'":** This indicates a missing npm package. Run `npm install` again.
*   **Frontend not updating:** If you make changes to the code but the browser doesn't reflect the changes, try refreshing the page or restarting the development server.
*   **Network errors:** If the frontend can't communicate with the backend, make sure the backend is running and that the URLs in the frontend code are correct.
