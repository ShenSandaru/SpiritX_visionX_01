# SecureConnect-visionX Backend Setup and Run Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the backend server for the SecureConnect-visionX application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:**  The backend is built using Node.js. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  It's recommended to use the LTS (Long Term Support) version.
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm usually comes bundled with Node.js. Verify it's installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
* **Database:** The application requires a database. The specific database and its setup are not detailed in the provided frontend files. Ensure you have set up the database and configures it accordingly.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
    Open your terminal and navigate to the `Backend` directory within the `SecureConnect-visionX` project.  The provided `README.md` in the `SecureConnect` folder mentions:  `(Backend running process in Backend folder)`
    ```bash
    cd path/to/SecureConnect-visionX/Backend 
    ```
    (Replace `path/to/SecureConnect-visionX` with the actual path to your project)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install the required npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file (which is expected to be in the `Backend` folder).

3.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Locate the database configuration file. This might be named something like `config.js`, `database.js`, or it might be within a `server.js` or `app.js` file. It's likely that the database settings are defined in environment variables.
    *   Update the database credentials (hostname, database name, username, password, etc.) to match your database setup.
    * Consider creating `.env` file in the `Backend` folder, where you can keep all the variables, instead of modifying the config file directly.

4. **Environment Variables**
   * You might need to set up environment variables if the backend uses them.
   * Create a `.env` file in the root of your `Backend` directory.
   * Add variables to the `.env` file, for example:

    ```
    MONGODB_URL=your_database_url
    PORT=5000
    ```
   * Update the code with `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

## Running the Backend

1.  **Start the Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed and the database is configured, start the server using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or, 
     ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    This command will typically start the server, and you should see a message in your terminal indicating that the server is running (e.g., "Server listening on port 5000").

2.  **Server Address:**
    The frontend code provided (in `Login.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`) is making requests to `http://localhost:5000`. This suggests the backend is expected to run on port `5000` by default.

## API Endpoints (Based on Provided Frontend Code)

The provided frontend code gives us an idea of the backend API endpoints:

*   **`POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup`:**  Used for user registration. It expects a JSON body with `username` and `password`.
*   **`POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login`:** Used for user login. It expects a JSON body with `username` and `password`. It returns a token.

## Stopping the Server

To stop the backend server, go to the terminal where it's running and press `Ctrl + C`.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Error: "Cannot find module '...'":** This indicates that a required npm package is missing. Re-run `npm install`.
*   **Error: "Connection refused":** This likely means the database server isn't running or the database credentials are incorrect. Double-check your database setup and configuration.
*   **Error: Port already in use:** If port `5000` is already in use, you will need to kill that process or change the backend configuration file to use another port.

## Further Development

As this is just the initial setup, more detailed API specification, database models, and other backend code will need to be developed. This guide provides a starting point.
